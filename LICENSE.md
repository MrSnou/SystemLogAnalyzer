Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations
     for the public:

Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public
License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License ("Public
License"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a
contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your
acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You
such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and
conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
synched in timed relation with a moving image.

b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights

categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
Rights.
d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
agreements.

e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
License.

g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.

i. NonCommercial means not primarily intended for or directed towards
commercial advantage or monetary compensation. For purposes of
this Public License, the exchange of the Licensed Material for

file-sharing or similar means is NonCommercial provided there is
no payment of monetary compensation in connection with the
exchange.

j. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
available to the public including in ways that members of the
public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

k. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,

equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

l. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part, for NonCommercial purposes only; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material for
               NonCommercial purposes only.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when
          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial
          purposes.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes
only;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
be made without permission under this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

   Licencjodawca niniejszym udziela Użytkownikowi ogólnoświatowej, nieodpłatnej,
   niepodlegającej sublicencjonowaniu, niewyłącznej, nieodwołalnej licencji na
   korzystanie z Praw Licencyjnych do Materiału Licencyjnego w celu:

a. powielania i Udostępniania Materiału Licencyjnego, w całości lub
części, wyłącznie w celach niekomercyjnych; oraz

b. tworzenia, powielania i Udostępniania Materiału Zaadaptowanego wyłącznie w
celach niekomercyjnych.

2. Wyjątki i ograniczenia. Dla uniknięcia wątpliwości, w przypadku gdy

   jej warunków.

3. Okres obowiązywania. Okres obowiązywania niniejszej Licencji Publicznej określono w Sekcji
   6(a).

   wszystkich mediach i formatach, zarówno znanych obecnie, jak i stworzonych w przyszłości,
   oraz do wprowadzania niezbędnych w tym celu modyfikacji technicznych. Licencjodawca
   zrzeka się i/lub zgadza się nie dochodzić żadnego prawa ani upoważnienia do
   zakazywania Użytkownikowi dokonywania modyfikacji technicznych
   niezbędnych do korzystania z Praw Licencyjnych, w tym
   modyfikacji technicznych niezbędnych do obejścia
   Skutecznych Środków Technicznych. Dla celów niniejszej Licencji Publicznej,
   samo wprowadzenie modyfikacji autoryzowanych na mocy niniejszej Sekcji 2(a)
   (4) nigdy nie prowadzi do powstania Materiału Zależnego.

5. Dalsi odbiorcy.

a. Oferta Licencjodawcy – Materiał Licencjonowany. Każdy
odbiorca Materiału Licencjonowanego automatycznie
otrzymuje od Licencjodawcy ofertę korzystania
z Praw Licencyjnych na warunkach niniejszej
Licencji Publicznej.

b. Brak ograniczeń dla dalszych odbiorców. Nie możesz oferować ani nakładać
żadnych dodatkowych lub odmiennych warunków ani
stosować żadnych Skutecznych Środków Technologicznych do
Materiału Licencjonowanego, jeśli takie działanie ograniczałoby wykonywanie
Praw Licencyjnych przez któregokolwiek odbiorcę Materiału Licencjonowanego.

6. Brak poparcia. Żadne z postanowień niniejszej Licencji Publicznej nie stanowi ani
   nie może być interpretowane jako zezwolenie na twierdzenie lub sugerowanie, że
   Ty jesteś, lub że Twoje korzystanie z Materiału Licencjonowanego jest, powiązane

   rozsądny sposób, w zależności od nośnika, środków i kontekstu,
   w którym Udostępniasz Materiał Licencjonowany. Na przykład,
   rozsądne może być spełnienie warunków poprzez podanie URI lub
   hiperłącza do zasobu zawierającego wymagane
   informacje.

3. Na żądanie Licencjodawcy, musisz usunąć wszelkie
   informacje wymagane na mocy Sekcji 3(a)(1)(A) w zakresie,
   w jakim jest to praktycznie możliwe.

4. Jeśli Udostępniasz Materiał Zaadaptowany, który stworzyłeś,
   stosowana przez Ciebie Licencja Twórcy Adaptującego nie może uniemożliwiać odbiorcom Materiału Zaadaptowanego
   przestrzegania niniejszej Licencji Publicznej.

Sekcja 4 – Prawa Sui Generis do Baz Danych.

W przypadku gdy Prawa Licencyjne obejmują Prawa Sui Generis do Baz Danych,
które mają zastosowanie do Twojego korzystania z Materiału Licencjonowanego:

a. W celu uniknięcia wątpliwości, Sekcja 2(a)(1) przyznaje Użytkownikowi prawo
do wyodrębniania, ponownego wykorzystywania, powielania i udostępniania całości lub znacznej
części
zawartości bazy danych wyłącznie do celów niekomercyjnych;

b. jeśli Użytkownik umieści całość lub znaczną część
zawartości bazy danych w bazie danych, do której przysługują mu Prawa Sui Generis do Bazy Danych, wówczas baza danych, do której przysługują mu Prawa Sui Generis do Bazy Danych (ale nie jej poszczególne treści), jest Materiałem Zaadaptowanym; oraz

c. Użytkownik musi przestrzegać warunków określonych w Sekcji 3(a), jeśli Udostępnia
całość lub znaczną część zawartości bazy danych.

W celu uniknięcia wątpliwości, niniejsza Sekcja 4 uzupełnia, a nie
zastępuje, Twoich zobowiązań wynikających z niniejszej Licencji Publicznej, w przypadku gdy Prawa
Licencjonowane obejmują inne Prawa Autorskie i Prawa Podobne.

   naruszenia; lub

uprawnienia Licencjodawcy do dochodzenia roszczeń z tytułu naruszeń
niniejszej Licencji Publicznej.
